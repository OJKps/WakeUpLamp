# WakeUpLamp
This is a simple WakeUpLamp to build yourself. The WakeUpLamp is made as simple as possible and safe to build and operate,
there is no need to work with high current. 
The core idea is to utilize the provided features of the IKEA TRÃ…DFRI lamp and its remote control. 
The remote control is switched via a RaspberryPi. 
This means that the lamp can be placed independently of the RaspberryPi and you do not have to work with large currents. 
To control the lamp, the Raspberry hosts a local website where you can fully control the lamp, set an alarm and much more.
